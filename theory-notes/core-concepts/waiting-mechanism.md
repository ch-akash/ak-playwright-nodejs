# Playwright Waiting Mechanism

***

Playwright offers two main approaches to waiting for elements or specific conditions in your tests:

## Automatic Waiting

***

Playwright has built-in waiting mechanisms that handle common scenarios without requiring explicit commands. These
checks happen before performing actions on elements, ensuring they are in a suitable state. Here's what Playwright waits
for automatically:

* **Actionability Checks:** Before interacting with an element (clicking, typing, etc.), Playwright verifies it meets
  specific criteria like being visible, stable, enabled, and receiving events. These checks improve test reliability by
  preventing actions on elements that might not be ready. You can find more details on these checks in the Playwright
  documentation on [actionability](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability).
* **Navigation and Network Conditions:** Playwright waits for page navigation and network requests to complete by
  default. Here are the relevant methods:
  * `page.waitForNavigation`: Waits until a new page navigation (URL change or reload) finishes.
  * `page.waitForLoadState`: Waits until a specific load state is reached (defaults to `"load"`).
  * `page.waitForNetworkIdle`: (Similar to Puppeteer) waits until all network calls have ended.
  * `page.waitForURL`: Waits until navigation to a specific target URL is complete.

## Explicit Waiting

***

For situations where automatic waiting isn't enough, Playwright provides methods for explicit control:

* **`page.waitForTimeout(timeout)`:** This method simply pauses script execution for a specified time in milliseconds.
  It's generally not recommended as it introduces fixed delays that can make tests less reliable across different
  environments.
* **`page.waitForFunction(function, timeout)`:** This method allows you to wait for a custom condition defined by a
  JavaScript function. The function should return `true` when the waiting condition is met, and Playwright will wait for
  the specified timeout (defaults to 30 seconds) for the condition to become true. This approach offers more flexibility
  for waiting based on specific criteria in your test.

**Choosing the Right Waiting Mechanism:**

* **Prioritize automatic waiting:** Leverage Playwright's built-in checks for most scenarios. They improve test
  reliability and readability by avoiding unnecessary waiting commands.
* **Use explicit waiting strategically:** For cases where automatic waiting isn't sufficient, like waiting for a
  specific element text content to change, employ `page.waitForFunction`.
* **Minimize fixed timeouts:** Avoid using `page.waitForTimeout` whenever possible. It can lead to flaky tests if
  network conditions or element rendering times vary.

## Recommendations

***

Explicit waits directly impact test reliability and performance, especially in complex scenarios. Here are some best
practices to optimize your waiting strategies:

* **Leverage Automatic Waiting:** Rely on Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms for most scenarios to improve test
  reliability.
* **Use Explicit Waiting Sparingly:** Employ `page.waitForFunction` judiciously for specific conditions that require
  custom waiting logic.
* **Avoid Fixed Timeouts:** Minimize the use of `page.waitForTimeout` to prevent flakiness in your tests due to
  unpredictable network conditions or element rendering times.
* **Combine Waiting Mechanisms:** In complex scenarios, consider combining automatic and explicit waiting to handle
  different conditions effectively.
* **Regularly Review Waiting Strategies:** Periodically review your waiting mechanisms to ensure they align with your
  test requirements and maintain test stability.
* **Monitor Test Execution:** Monitor your test execution to identify areas where waiting mechanisms can be optimized
  for better test performance and reliability.
